html-duration-picker.js
=========

html-duration-picker.js is a very tiny JS library to turn native HTML text inputs into duration pickers. The aim is for the picker to feel like a native element as much as possible.

**BEFORE** ```<input type="text"> ```

**AFTER** ```<input type="text" html-duration-picker>```
![Default Input](https://github.com/nadchif/html-duration-picker.js/blob/master/screenshots/default-after.jpg)

Why use html-duration-picker? 

* Tiny (~5kb)
* No additional dependencies (css, jquery or whatever). 
* Compatible with Bootstrap 3 and 4
* You can modify and improve it :-)
* Absolutely FREE!
